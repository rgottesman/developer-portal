## Webhooks

Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when an event occurs.
They contain data and commands sent over HTTP.

Surfsight makes an HTTP request to the URL you configure for your
webhook. This request contains GPS data or data about events, often with
snapshots or videos attached.
