## REST APIs

An API (Application Programming Interface) enables programs to talk to
each other. REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are APIs that
use HTTP requests at a predefined set of URLs.

These URLs represent content accessed at that location, which can be
returned as JSON, HTML, audio files, or images. Resources usually have
one or more methods that can be performed on them over HTTP,
like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. In general, use GET to receive
resources, POST to create resources, PUT to update resources, and DELETE
to remove resources.

Surfsight provides many REST APIs for receiving information from your
devices, updating the settings of your devices, adding new
organizations, removing users, and more. The Surfsight API has two
regions of service:

-   North America - api-prod.surfsight.net

-   Europe - api.de.surfsight.net
