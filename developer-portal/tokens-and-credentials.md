## Tokens & credentials

To start using the Surfsight API, you need to first authenticate
yourself. The Surfsight API uses Bearer authentication and you receive
an authentication token. This process is detailed in [Basic
authentication](basic-authentication.md).

This token gives you access to the API operations according to your
role, as described in [What credential options are
there?](what-credential-options-are-there.md). If you make a call using an
API operation you don\'t have access to, an error is returned.
