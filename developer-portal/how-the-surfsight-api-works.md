# How the Surfsight API works

Our API is based on [REST APIs](rest-apis.md) and uses
[webhooks](webhooks.md) to let you know when events occur. To leverage our
API successfully, it\'s important to understand certain
[concepts](surfsight-concepts.md) and to understand [tokens and
credentials](tokens-and-credentials.md).
