# How the Surfsight API works

Our API is based on [REST APIs](#rest-apis) and uses
[webhooks](#webhooks) to let you know when events occur. To leverage our
API successfully, it\'s important to understand certain
[concepts](#surfsight-concepts) and to understand [tokens and
credentials](#tokens-credentials).
